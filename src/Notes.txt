=> In loginPage css we have adjusted the css react-tel-input .flag-dropdown && .react-tel-input .selected-flag manually this should be corrected.
=> In login.js file Need to check why myPhonenumber is returning a object instead of number after taking input
=> If already a user logins again need to handle name scenario.
=> get all the text values from Db instead of hardcode values

Behaviour of the app:
- ABOUT section: 
- NEED REFERRAL section: User can submit their details for job opportunities (needs resume file)
  - Resume is stored in Db
  - If any other user, opts for `can refer` the stored resumes will be shared to this user (through email)
- CAN REFER section: 
  - Needs work email (implemented)
  - For privacy concerns, we need to setup OTP verification through work email (TO DO)
  - Once the `can refer` section is completed by the user, admin will verify and email the resumes accordingly
- STUDENT section:
  - Need to display job opportunities
