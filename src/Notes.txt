=> In loginPage css we have adjusted the css react-tel-input .flag-dropdown && .react-tel-input .selected-flag manually this should be corrected.
=> In login.js file Need to check why myPhonenumber is returning a object instead of number after taking input
=> If already a user logins again need to handle name scenario.
=> get all the text values from Db instead of hardcode values

Behaviour of the app:
- ABOUT section: 
- NEED REFERRAL section: User can submit their details for job opportunities (needs resume file)
  - Resume is stored in Db
  - If any other user, opts for `can refer` the stored resumes will be shared to this user (through email)
- CAN REFER section: 
  - Needs work email (implemented)
  - For privacy concerns, we need to setup OTP verification through work email (TO DO)
  - Once the `can refer` section is completed by the user, admin will verify and email the resumes accordingly
- STUDENT section:
  - Need to display job opportunities

  -- PROD file not found 404 error - done
  trail and error 
    1. updated package.json where we update homepage and private properties.
        "homepage": "https://asvashrith.github.io/referralBroMain", -- added repo name to the URL didn't worked.
        "private": false,
    2. Removing repo name in homepage property and only keeping private property to false. -- failed
    3. trying with renaming the name of the repo from referralBroMain to referralbromain as app "name" property is referralbromain --failed
    4. Try out with hashrouter instead of Browser router.
    5. Added 404.html file to fix the issue and replaces hashrouter to browserrouter
    RCA : github pages don't support browser router of react as it is a client-side routing there are 2 fixes for this one is replacing hashrouter instead of Browser router this option didn't worked for us may be our complete app is not wrapped in the router.
    option 2 was to add 404.html file which redirects when ever there is a direct URL this file is found in react community which is a standard fix and made changes to index.html as well.
